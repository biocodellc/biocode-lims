## Developer Information
The Biocode LIMS plugin is built and developed using IntelliJ and gradle.  Currently, we develop against the geneiousPublicAPIVersion = 11.1.5 and use Java 8.
There are a couple of issues preventing compiling using Java 11 and hence being able to develop against GeneiousPrime:
 * openJFK libraries were removed in Java 11.  See issue: https://github.com/biocodellc/biocode-lims/issues/116
 * ClassLoader issues cropped up in Java 9 See issue: https://community.oracle.com/thread/4011800
